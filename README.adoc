== mmm
This repository itself is only used as link:../../wiki[wiki] for some general documentation aspects of https://m-m-m.github.io[].
Also this project contains an aggregator `pom.xml` for the entire project.
In your project workspace folder clone all the repositories as subfolders side-by-side:

* mmm
* base
* ...
* value

then simply create a symbolic link to this POM in that project workspace folder:
```
ln -s mmm/pom.xml pom.xml
```

Now, you can build the entire project with all its sub-projects from individual modules:
```
mvn clean install
```

== release
```
mvn -Pdeploy -Drevision=x.y.z clean deploy
./tagger.sh x.y.z
```
