    <faq id="mmm">
      <question>Is it mmm, m-m-m or what?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>The project name is Multi-Media-Manager. The shortcut is officially mmm.
	However another project was already registered with that name at sourceforge
	so the sourceforge project id is m-m-m. Since m-m-m can not be used in some
	technical situations (e.g. Java package names), it is only used for
	sourceforge related stuff. The java package namespace is net.sf.mmm while the 
	maven-groupId is net.sf.m-m-m.</p>
